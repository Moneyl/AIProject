# AIProject
AI Project for Fall 2020 Artificial Intelligence class at SUNY Poly.

## Setup
This project uses [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) to create environments to test AI in. To install it you'll need python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/ . Any version 3.5.x or greater should suffice. To test if you already have python installed and what version open a command line and enter `python --version`. Rest of the steps:
- Once python is installed open up a command line and enter `pip install gym` to install gym with pythons package manager, pip. You'll need to open a fresh command line window for python to be available if you just installed it. 
- Download a copy of this repo. Either with [git](https://git-scm.com/) via `git clone https://github.com/Moneyl/AIProject.git` or by clicking the green 'Code' button and selecting 'Downloading ZIP'.
- All the code is in main.py. Run it from the command line by cd'ing to the folder and entering `python main.py`. If you're using visual studio code or another editor/IDE you can set up buttons and keyboard shortcuts to do this.
